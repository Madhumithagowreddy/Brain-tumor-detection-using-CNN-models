# Brain-tumor-detection-using-CNN-models
A Brain tumor detection through different CNN feature extraction models like VGG16,ResNet50,MobileNet v2 and we used SVM classification in VGG16,ResNet50 models.
We did fine tuning for ResNet50,MobileNetv2 .Here We basically took a yes or no dataset of brain tumor to detect using these 4 different models.Later on compare all 4 models ,we came to a conclusion that ResNet50-fine tuning gives the highest accuracy for detection
